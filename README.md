# CrowdBeats Party Hosting


This Node JS Express application is to host a Crowdbeats Party.

This was developed mostly over 24 hours at ICHack 19, but has been in relatively active development since.


## How do I use this?

The application is currently hosted on Heroku, and only supports one party instance at once. 


1. Head to http://crowdbeats-host.herokuapp.com
2. Login to Spotify
3. Share the Party Code with your friends
4. They should head to http://crowdbeats-client.herokuapp.com to join the party using the party code!
